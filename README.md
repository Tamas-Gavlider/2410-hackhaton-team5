# Track My Job

An user-friendly application that helps users efficiently manage and track their job applications. Applying for jobs across multiple platforms can quickly become overwhelming, making it difficult to monitor each application's status. With Track My Job, users can easily keep track of all their job applications in one place. The app provides visual insights, such as pie charts, to display application statistics, helping users evaluate and adjust their job search strategies as needed.<br>

## Agile Development

The project was developed using Agile principles throughout. User stories were prioritized using MoSCoW, and the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was identified for early deployment.

## User Experience(UX)

### User Stories

User Stories were tracked throughout the project as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/users/Tamas-Gavlider/projects/4). 

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Palette](docs/colours.png)

#F2EBE1 (Off-white) – Great for background elements, keeping things clean and minimal.<br>
#305F6D (Teal) – Ideal for headers, highlights, or icons to bring focus and contrast.<br>
#BF6E15 (Orange) – This strong accent color could be used for buttons, call-to-actions, or important highlights to draw attention.<br>
#C1884E (Light Brown) – A softer tone that would pair well with the orange, maybe for secondary buttons or text.<br>
#698C8E (Muted Blue) – A calming color that would work great for less prominent text, borders, or nav/ footer sections.

This palette balances warm and cool tones, making the app feel both welcoming and trustworthy

### Wireframe

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.<br>

### Typography

Poppins from Google Fonts was chosen to ensure the text is easy to read. Its letterforms are nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary, maintaining an even typographic color.

### Features

All pages feature a fully responsive navbar that transforms into a hamburger menu on smaller screens and a [favicon](static/images/apple-touch-icon.png) in the browser tab.<br>
Navbar if user logged in<br>

Navbar if user is not registered/logged in<br>
![Logged out](docs/screenshots/logged-out-header.png)

#### Home

The home page features a welcome message explaining why to choose this tool, along with login and register buttons.
![home page](docs/screenshots/home-page.png)

#### Job Applications

Accessible only to registered and logged-in users. Users can view their job applications, add new ones, or edit existing ones. If users prefer not to use the dashboard, they can easily add their job applications directly on the Job Applications page.

![Job view](/docs/screenshots/job-applications_view.png)

#### Dashboard

Accessible only to registered and logged-in users. One of the key component of the application. It not only allows users to add new job applications but also provides a visual overview of their existing ones through various charts. By comparing successful applications with unsuccessful ones, users can gain valuable insights into which roles are the best fit for them.

#### Contact

Users can fill out a contact form to provide feedback on bugs or suggest potential future features.

#### Team Page

Introduction of team members who worked on this project.

#### Future Implementations

Integrate the application with LinkedIn APIs, allowing new job applications to automatically flow into the app and appear on the dashboard.<br>
The application may also be suitable for corporations to track job application records for future employees by implementing automated email notifications whenever the status of an application changes.
